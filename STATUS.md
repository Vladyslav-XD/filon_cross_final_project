## 2026-09-18 · task 1 — delete own recipe (Claude Code)
- `RecipeDetailsScreen`: "Delete Recipe" below "Share Recipe", shown only when the id is in the `myRecipes` store (`useSelector`), so TheCocktailDB drinks never get it. Outlined in `colors.error`, not filled — destructive but not the loudest button on the screen. Confirmation via `Alert.alert` ("Delete this recipe?" / Cancel / Delete, destructive style). On confirm, in this order: `deleteRecipePhoto(recipe.imageUrl)` → remove from favourites if saved → `dispatch(removeRecipe(id))` → `navigation.goBack()`. Photo first: once the recipe leaves the store nothing points at the file any more.
- Added `TrashIcon` to `src/components/icons/index.tsx` (the set had none). Light `colors.error` changed `#ff0000` → `#DC2626`: the token was unused anywhere, and pure red on white is harsh.
- `styles.shareBtn` bottom margin `xxl` → `m` so Share and Delete sit as one pair; the scroll view already pads 100 at the bottom.
- Files: `src/screens/RecipeDetailsScreen.tsx`, `src/components/icons/index.tsx`, `src/theme/colors.ts`.
- Verified: `npx tsc --noEmit` clean, `npx expo export --platform ios` builds the bundle, app launches in the iPhone 17 simulator with the new code (home list and navigation fine).
- **Not yet verified by hand:** the tap-through (create a recipe with a photo → delete → photo file gone, list updates). This session cannot tap in the simulator — macOS assistive access is not granted to the terminal — so Vlad or Cowork should run that once.

## 2026-09-18 · task 0 — tag the reviewed state (Claude Code)
- Annotated tag `v1.0.0-build4` created on `2f32cfb` ("Character tags, real filters, recipe photos") — the commit Apple is reviewing as 1.0.0 build 4. Tag is local only; not pushed (needs Vlad's ok, and the GitHub remote still has old history).
- Branch `release/1.1` created from `2f32cfb` and checked out; `master` is left untouched at the reviewed state. All 1.1 work goes on `release/1.1`.
- Files: `TASKS.md`, `STATUS.md` (this entry), plus `CLAUDE.md` committed for the first time — all three were untracked until now.
- Still untracked on purpose: `assets/drinks/` and `src/data/drinkPhotos.ts` (they go in with task 6, as the queue asks), and the `Claude outputs/` folder (working screenshots/notes — Vlad decides whether it belongs in the repo).
- Verified: `git tag -l` shows the tag, `git show v1.0.0-build4` points at `2f32cfb`, `git branch --show-current` = `release/1.1`.

## 2026-09-17 · drink photos ready (Cowork)
- Vlad generated 58 photos (2048×2048 JPEG, consistent studio style) in `~/Desktop/Mocktail Finder 1.1/photos/`. Cowork resized them to 900×900 JPEG q82 → `assets/drinks/<id>.jpg` (58 files, 2.9 MB total) and generated `src/data/drinkPhotos.ts` (`drinkPhoto(id)`). Verified: every one of the 58 TheCocktailDB ids has a file, no extras, `npx tsc --noEmit` clean. Task 6 in TASKS.md is unblocked — wiring the map into the screens is Claude Code's part.

## 2026-09-17 · setup (Cowork)
- 1.0 (1.0.0 build 4) is in App Review; reply to Apple's "Information Needed" sent 16 Sept, waiting. No 1.1 code written yet.
- Added `CLAUDE.md`, `TASKS.md`, `STATUS.md`. Claude Code takes the queue in `TASKS.md`; Cowork handles App Store Connect, texts, screenshots and drink photos.
